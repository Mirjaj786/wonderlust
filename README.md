📌 Problem

Travelers often face difficulties in finding unique, affordable, and trustworthy accommodations in one place, while property owners struggle to reach potential guests.

💡 Solution

Centralized listings of stays (treehouses, cottages, lofts, etc.) with transparent pricing (₹/night + GST).

Authentication system (Sign Up / Login) for personalized experiences.

Host dashboard (“Airbnb your home”) to allow property owners to create and manage their listings.

Category-based browsing (Trending, Room, Beach, etc.) for easy discovery.

Responsive UI with Bootstrap/Tailwind for mobile and desktop users.

🚀 Impact

Streamlines the process of exploring and booking accommodations online.

Provides property owners a simple platform to showcase stays.

Mimics real-world platforms like Airbnb, demonstrating scalable full-stack web development skills.
